# blanket.js

simple js code coverage

## Philosophy

Blanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:

1. Easy to install
2. Easy to use
3. Easy to understand

Blanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.

## Mechanism

JavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).

Blanket works in a 3 step process:

1. Instrumenting code, creating a temporary copy of your source files which are modified to include line-tracking code
2. Remapping, modifying or creating a new test runner that references the instrumented sources, instead of the originals
3. Output, displaying the code coverage results in the browser or in the command line after the tests have completed.
